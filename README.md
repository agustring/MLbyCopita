# Machine Learning Course by Agustin Copita
Repository for Machine Learning Course

It contains several projects that I did for this course, I will detail the purpose of each one below:

*	TP1 was about data visualization and analysis, the objective was to find out in which dataset a point fits best, there were 4 points ([16.8] [8.6] [16.10] [16.6] ) and 4 data sets

*	TP2 was an introduction to the world of machine learning, this time a dataset with inconsistent data is analyzed and then, in a separate exercise, the difference between separating two groups of Gaussian distribution with a threshold and with SVM is marked.

*	TP3 I learned with KNN certain dataset training and validation methods, first with a dataset of two Gaussian distributions and then with a Spotify song dataset, the parameters of the model and the attributes to be trained are adjusted.

*	TP4 I looked at several classifiers with their main advantages and then from a Wisconsin breast cancer dataset I solved a problem about classifying tumors between benign and malignant.

*	TP5 I learned clustering as an unsupervised learning, I used the KMeans algorithm to separate into groups a consumer dataset whose parameters were based on an annual statistics.

*	TP6 I learned different types of regression and used decision trees to find which attribute had the most weight in the salary of a basketball player based on a dataset with players from 1985 to 2018

*	**theRealFinal** notebook contains the last proyect based on decomposing a signal by it's components with PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The problem to solve was a traffic sign classifier, and I used dimensionality reduction to train a C-Support Vector Classification or SVC. The results are very good with an F1 score of 0.91.
